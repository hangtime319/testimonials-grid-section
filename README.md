# Testimonials Grid Section

A responsive component featuring a grid of testimonials, built with pure HTML and CSS.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Testimonials grid section" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to create a clean and modern component with a specific, asymmetrical grid layout. This project is an excellent exercise in mastering advanced **CSS Grid**, demonstrating how to position elements of different sizes and shapes to create a unique and visually balanced design without the need for JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the testimonials, including the profile images, names, quotes, and content.
* **CSS3:** This is the sole technology for all the styling. The core of this project is the **CSS Grid** layout, which was used to arrange the cards dynamically and responsively. CSS also handles typography, colors, and shadows.
* **JavaScript:** This is a purely static project. No JavaScript was required for any functionality.
